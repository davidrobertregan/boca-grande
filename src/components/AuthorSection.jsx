        <p>
          Julie Horning is a real estate agent, proud mother and grandmother, and former leader in the direct selling world, where she built teams and empowered women. 
          <br /><br />
          Inspired by her love for Boca Grande, a charming town on Gasparilla Island, she wrote "B is for Boca Grande", a children's alphabet book celebrating its beauty and history. 
          <br /><br />
          Julie has also been actively involved in nonprofit work, frequently supporting women and children. She and her husband, Dan, now call Boca Grande home, where community and connection remain at the heart of all she does.
